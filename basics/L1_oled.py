# L1_oled program for Raspberry Pi, used in lab 2 exercises. Does not display SSID, for simplicity
# Runs the SSD1306 with I2C and displays a title and IP address that is updated every second
# Before running, make sure to stop the default OLED service with the terminal command: 
#            sudo systemctl stop oled.service

# To restart the default OLED service, run the terminal command: 
#            sudo systemctl restart oled.service

# NOTE!!!
# This code is intended for reference and to demonstrate the the functionality of the OLED display.
# The code temporarily displays on the OLED while it is running and stops displaying when the script
# is terminated. It is not intended to, and should not, replace the oled.py service file for continously
# displaying to the OLED from boot. Please reference and use the oled.py file for this use case.

## Functions to get readings for IP and voltage ##

    #       You should be able to accomplish this task with one line of code.
